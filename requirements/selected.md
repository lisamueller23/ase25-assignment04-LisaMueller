## Select Requirements

FR: As a customer, I want to view the list of ingredients required for each meal so that I know that it only contains ingredients that I like.
NFR: As a customer, I want the platform to be intuitive to use so that I can easily navigate.

# Why you should selected this FR and this NFR for your development?
This functional requirement was chosen because showing ingredients is a core feature that helps customers decide whether a meal suits their preferences or allergies. The non-functional requirement was selected because an intuitive interface is essential to ensure ingredient information is easy to find and understand.

# How these two requirements relate to each other?
The functional requirement relies on good usability, as ingredient information is only useful if it is presented clearly. An intuitive platform ensures users can quickly access and interpret ingredient lists.

# Why implementing the chosen FR is a reasonable scope for the prototype?
Implementing the ingredient-viewing feature is a reasonable prototype scope because it is a self-contained function that demonstrates real value to customers. It requires building a clear meal-to-ingredient mapping and a simple interface to display it, which can be achieved without needing the full ordering or delivery system.
