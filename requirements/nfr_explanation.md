# NFR Explanation

The implementation attempts to meet the chosen non-functional requirement of to be intuitive to use by providing a simple console interface where customers can clearly see available meals and directly enter the name to view ingredients. The program guides the user step by step. The user can decide if he wants th see the ingredients of a meal or to exit the program. The design ensures that even users with minimal technical knowledge can navigate the system without difficulty. 

A limitation of the current prototype is that it requires exact meal names to be typed correctly, which may reduce usability if users make spelling mistakes. Another assumption is that if the JSON file is missing or incorrect, the program will not run as expected.
